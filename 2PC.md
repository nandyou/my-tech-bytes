2PC, or Two-Phase Commit, is a distributed transaction protocol used to ensure atomicity across multiple systems or databases. It coordinates a single transaction across multiple participants, so either all commit or all roll back, maintaining consistency across systems.

üîπ Why Use 2PC?
When a transaction spans multiple systems (e.g., microservices or databases), and you want to ensure they all either succeed or fail together, you can use 2PC to coordinate this.

üß± How 2PC Works
It has two phases:

‚úÖ Phase 1: Prepare (Voting Phase)
A coordinator asks all participants (e.g., databases, services) to prepare to commit.

Each participant:

Executes the operation (e.g., reserve funds, insert records)

Writes the changes to a transaction log (but does not commit yet)

Responds with "Ready" (or "Yes") if successful, or "No" if not

‚úÖ Phase 2: Commit/Rollback
If all participants vote Yes, the coordinator sends a commit command.

If any vote No, the coordinator sends a rollback command.

Each participant commits or rolls back accordingly.

‚úÖ Example Scenario
Suppose a payment service needs to:

Deduct money from Wallet Service

Update order status in Order Service

With 2PC:

Coordinator asks both services to prepare

Both agree ‚Üí commit

Any fail ‚Üí rollback

‚ö†Ô∏è Why 2PC Is Rarely Used in Microservices
Though 2PC guarantees consistency, it's not commonly used in microservices due to:

Concern	Details
Blocking	Participants may hold locks during the commit phase, reducing throughput
Single Point of Failure	If the coordinator crashes mid-transaction, participants may hang indefinitely
Poor Scalability	Doesn't scale well with large numbers of services
Complex Recovery	Recovery from failure is hard, especially without a centralized system

üü© Modern Alternatives
To avoid 2PC, microservice architectures often use:

Saga Pattern: Local transactions + compensating actions

Event-driven architecture: Asynchronous communication with eventual consistency

Outbox Pattern: Reliable event publishing from within a transaction

üìå Summary
2PC (Two-Phase Commit)	Description
Purpose	Ensure all-or-nothing across multiple systems
Phases	Prepare + Commit/Rollback
Strong Consistency	Yes
Use in Microservices	Rare ‚Äì replaced by Sagas, Eventual Consistency
Tradeoffs	Blocking, complex, slower, fragile under failure
