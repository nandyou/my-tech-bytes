## Factors to Consider while creating cache
# Talk about Eviction Policy
  - LRU (least recently used)
  - FIFO (first in first out)
# Talk about TTL (time to live)
  - low TTL
    - when we need high accuracy 
  - High TTL
    - when we dont need high accuracy
    - when high cache hit is more desirable 
    - when downstream is not changing more frequently
