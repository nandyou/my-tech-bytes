### Notes:
1. **ArrayList** and **LinkedList**: In Java, `ArrayList` is backed by a dynamic array, and `LinkedList` is a doubly linked list.
2. **HashMap** and **HashSet**: These are implemented using hash tables. The average-case time complexity is O(1) due to the efficient hash function, but it can degrade to O(n) in the worst case due to collisions.
3. **TreeMap** and **TreeSet**: These are implemented using Red-Black Trees, which provide O(log n) complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.
4. **PriorityQueue**: Typically implemented with a binary heap.
5. **LinkedHashMap** and **LinkedHashSet**: These maintain a doubly linked list running through all of its entries, which defines the iteration ordering, typically the order in which keys were inserted into the map or set.
6. **Stack** and **Queue**: Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. The complexities provided here assume `ArrayList` for stack and 
`LinkedList` for queue implementation.

This table summarizes the typical average-case complexities for these operations and does not take into account the specifics of worst-case scenarios, which can differ depending on implementation details and specific use cases.
