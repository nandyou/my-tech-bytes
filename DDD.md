**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is a software development approach focused on modeling software to match the **business domain** it serves. It was introduced by **Eric Evans** in his book *"Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"*.

Here’s a breakdown of what DDD is and why it matters:

---

### 🚀 Core Idea

DDD helps teams **build better software** by:

* **Understanding the business domain deeply**, and
* **Structuring the code around this understanding**, not just technical concerns.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

#### 1. **Domain**

* The **domain** is the area of knowledge or activity your software is built for (e.g., banking, healthcare, logistics).

#### 2. **Ubiquitous Language**

* A **shared vocabulary** between developers and domain experts.
* Everyone should use the same terms (e.g., “Order,” “Shipment,” “Customer”) to avoid confusion.

#### 3. **Bounded Context**

* A **boundary** within which a specific model is defined and applicable.
* Different parts of the system can have different models of the same concept, and that’s okay.

  * E.g., a “Customer” in billing might be different from a “Customer” in marketing.

#### 4. **Entities and Value Objects**

* **Entity**: Has a unique identity (e.g., a user or order).
* **Value Object**: Described only by its attributes, not identity (e.g., an address or money amount).

#### 5. **Aggregates**

* A **cluster of domain objects** that are treated as a single unit.
* One entity is the **aggregate root**, and access to the rest is only through it.

#### 6. **Repositories**

* Used to **retrieve and store aggregates**.
* They abstract away the data storage logic.

#### 7. **Domain Events**

* Events that capture things that **happen within the domain** (e.g., "PaymentReceived").

### 💡 Why Use DDD?

* Handles **complex business rules** more cleanly.
* Promotes better **communication between developers and business stakeholders**.
* Encourages **modular**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** systems.

### 🧭 When to Use DDD

Use it when:

* You're building software in a **complex domain**.
* **Business rules and logic** are central.
* You can work closely with **domain experts** (not just stakeholders).

Avoid it when:

* The project is **simple** or mostly **CRUD**.
* There’s no clear domain expert or frequent business changes.
