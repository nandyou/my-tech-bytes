üß† Key Concepts in System Design

‚∏ª

1. ‚öôÔ∏è Scalability

Definition: The ability of a system to handle increased load (traffic, data, users) without compromising performance.
	‚Ä¢	Horizontal Scaling: Add more machines (e.g., more web servers).
	‚Ä¢	Vertical Scaling: Add more power (CPU/RAM) to existing machines.

Example: Twitter scaling their backend to handle millions of tweets per minute.

‚∏ª

2. üì¶ Load Balancing

Definition: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overloading a single server.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
	‚Ä¢	Common tools: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB.

Example:

User ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí [Server 1, Server 2, Server 3]


‚∏ª

3. üß∞ Caching

Definition: Temporarily storing frequently accessed data to reduce load and latency.
	‚Ä¢	Client-side, Server-side, or CDN-based caching.
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Redis, Memcached, Varnish.

Example: Caching user profile data so you don‚Äôt hit the database every time.

‚∏ª

4. üõ¢Ô∏è Database Design

Definition: Designing a schema and choosing the right type of database for the data.
	‚Ä¢	Relational (SQL): PostgreSQL, MySQL (for structured data).
	‚Ä¢	NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra (for unstructured, flexible data).
	‚Ä¢	Concepts: Normalization, Sharding, Replication, Indexes.

Example: Using MongoDB to store chat messages in a messaging app.

‚∏ª

5. üì§ API Design

Definition: Designing interfaces for components to communicate (REST, GraphQL, gRPC).
	‚Ä¢	Concise, versioned, well-documented APIs.
	‚Ä¢	REST uses HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).

Example: GET /users/123 ‚Üí fetches user data.

‚∏ª

6. üìä Data Partitioning (Sharding)

Definition: Splitting a large database into smaller parts to improve performance.
	‚Ä¢	Horizontal Sharding: Divide rows across DBs.
	‚Ä¢	Vertical Sharding: Divide tables across DBs.

Example: Splitting user data across databases based on user region (US, EU, Asia).

‚∏ª

7. üîÑ Replication

Definition: Copying data from one database server to another for redundancy and availability.
	‚Ä¢	Master-slave or multi-master setups.

Example: Reading from replicas to reduce load on the master database.

‚∏ª

8. üß± Microservices

Definition: Breaking down a large application into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs.
	‚Ä¢	Easier to deploy, scale, and develop independently.
	‚Ä¢	Each service has its own database and logic.

Example:
	‚Ä¢	Auth Service
	‚Ä¢	Payment Service
	‚Ä¢	User Profile Service

‚∏ª

9. ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate Limiting

Definition: Restricting the number of requests a user/system can make in a time period.
	‚Ä¢	Prevents abuse and overload.

Example: Only allow 100 API calls per hour per user.

‚∏ª

10. üîê Security

Definition: Protecting the system against attacks and data breaches.
	‚Ä¢	Use HTTPS, authentication (OAuth, JWT), encryption, input validation, firewalls.

Example: OAuth 2.0 for Google login.

‚∏ª

11. üìâ Monitoring and Logging

Definition: Tracking the system‚Äôs performance, usage, and errors.
	‚Ä¢	Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog, Sentry

Example: Alerting when CPU usage exceeds 90%.

‚∏ª

12. ‚è±Ô∏è Latency and Throughput
	‚Ä¢	Latency: Time taken to respond to a request.
	‚Ä¢	Throughput: Number of requests processed per second.

Goal: Keep latency low, throughput high

‚∏ª

üöÄ Real-World Example: URL Shortener (e.g., Bitly)

Key Design Elements:
	‚Ä¢	High write & read throughput
	‚Ä¢	Database with fast lookups (e.g., Redis or NoSQL)
	‚Ä¢	Unique ID generation (e.g., Base62)
	‚Ä¢	Caching popular URLs
	‚Ä¢	Load balancer for traffic
