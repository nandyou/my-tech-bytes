Explaining 9 types of API testing. The method to download the high-resolution PDF is available at the end. 
 
## Smoke Testing 
This is done after API development is complete. Simply validate if the APIs are working and nothing breaks. 
 
## Functional Testing 
This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements and compares the results with the expected results. 
 
## Integration Testing 
This test combines several API calls to perform end-to-end tests. The intra-service communications and data transmissions are tested. 
 
## Regression Testing 
This test ensures that bug fixes or new features shouldn’t break the existing behaviors of APIs. 
 
## Load Testing 
This tests applications’ performance by simulating different loads. Then we can calculate the capacity of the application. 
 
## Stress Testing 
We deliberately create high loads to the APIs and test if the APIs are able to function normally. 
 
## Security Testing 
This tests the APIs against all possible external threats. 
 
## UI Testing 
This tests the UI interactions with the APIs to make sure the data can be displayed properly. 
 
## Fuzz Testing 
This injects invalid or unexpected input data into the API and tries to crash the API. In this way, it identifies the API vulnerabilities.
