Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown of the differences between various UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) versions, especially v1 to v5, which are the most commonly used.

â¸»

ðŸ”¢ UUID Versions Overview

Version	Name	Basis	Collision Risk	Use Case
v1	Time-based	Timestamp + MAC address	Low	Ordered IDs, needs uniqueness in time & space
v2	DCE Security	v1 + POSIX UID/GID	Rarely used	UNIX-specific environments
v3	Name-based (MD5)	Hash of name + namespace (MD5)	Deterministic	Same input â†’ same UUID
v4	Random	Random numbers	Very low	General use, widely adopted
v5	Name-based (SHA-1)	Hash of name + namespace (SHA-1)	Deterministic	Like v3 but more secure hashing

ðŸ§  Detailed Breakdown

ðŸ”¹ UUID v1 â€“ Time-Based
	â€¢	Uses: Current timestamp + MAC address of host.
	â€¢	Pros: Sortable, highly unique.
	â€¢	Cons: Leaks timestamp and MAC (privacy risk).
	â€¢	Format: UUID = time + clock_seq + node(MAC)

Example:

f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ UUID v2 â€“ DCE Security
	â€¢	Extension of v1 with embedded POSIX UID/GID.
	â€¢	Rarely used today due to complexity and lack of support.

â¸»

ðŸ”¹ UUID v3 â€“ Name-Based (MD5)
	â€¢	Input: namespace UUID + name string
	â€¢	Output: MD5 hash â†’ deterministic UUID
	â€¢	Good for consistent UUID generation across systems.

Example:

uuid.uuid3(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, "example.com")
# â†’ 5df41881-3aed-3515-88a7-2f4a814cf09e


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ UUID v4 â€“ Random-Based
	â€¢	Fully random (122 random bits).
	â€¢	Most commonly used in practice.
	â€¢	Very low probability of collision.

Example:

4e5e6c5e-e39b-4d35-bb42-5f7deda5eabf


â¸»

ðŸ”¹ UUID v5 â€“ Name-Based (SHA-1)
	â€¢	Same concept as v3 but uses SHA-1 instead of MD5.
	â€¢	More secure and preferred over v3.
	â€¢	Still deterministic.

Example:

uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_DNS, "example.com")
# â†’ 2ed6657d-e927-568b-95e1-2665a8aea6a2

âœ… Which Should You Use?
	â€¢	v4 â†’ General use (default in many libraries).
	â€¢	v1 â†’ If you need ordered or timestamp-based UUIDs (but with privacy concerns).
	â€¢	v5 â†’ When you want deterministic UUIDs from known values (e.g., for caching keys).
